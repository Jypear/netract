# netract

A comprehensive tool to collect, version, and extract data from network device configurations.

## Goals

There is a common problem when attempting to adopt network automation

- When attempting to generate configuration, existing device configurations can be complex
- There is no way to extract that information in a readable format for the most part.
- This tool attempts to backup network configuration and provide the ability to integrate plugins for extracting that information to be migrated into a source of truth.
- This informaiton can be presented to a user using a comprehensive API or GUI.
